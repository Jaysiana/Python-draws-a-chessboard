//this is one of my colledge session works that was complicated to get done and I am proud that I managed to figure out the logic :)

This program can draw chessboard with any given numbers. When program starts it asks user for two numbers.

NB! Maximum recommended size is m(vertical) 22 and n(horizontal) 42.
